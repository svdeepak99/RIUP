# Measuring RF Signal Propagation Delay
These codes are used to find the time delay caused while sending a signal from the transmitter Arduino and receiving it from the Receiver Arduino, through the RF Module. This time delay that fairly remains constant, could be entered in Step-3 so that the TOF (Time of Flight) of the ultrasound can be obtained with better accuracy.
