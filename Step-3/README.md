# Distance measurement using 1 Ultrasound transmitter, wirelessly with RF:
This code can find the distance between an ultrasound transmitter (connected to transmitter Arduino) and an ultrasound receiver (connected to receiver Arduino), wirelessly with Radio signals for time syncing.

The RF transmitter module is connected to the transmitter Arduino and the RF receiver module is connected to the receiver Arduino. A radio signal is sent every time before transmitting the ultrasound, to start the TOF counter on the receiver Arduino.
